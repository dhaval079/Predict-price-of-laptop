## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of laptops based on a set of features. The model is built using regression techniques and is implemented in Python.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Flask

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhaval079/Price-Prediction-Model.git
  sh```
  
#Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Price-Prediction-Model
```

Install the required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage

To use the laptop price prediction model:

Run app.py to start the Streamlit app:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

Follow the instructions on the app to input laptop features and get a price prediction.

## Steps
### Data Collection
We collected data from various sources to create a comprehensive dataset of laptop specifications and prices.

### Data Preprocessing
We cleaned the collected data, handled missing values, and performed data transformations to make it suitable for model training.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, visualize feature distributions, and identify potential patterns.

### Feature Engineering
We engineered new features based on domain knowledge and performed feature selection to enhance the predictive power of the model.

### Model Training
We trained a regression model using the preprocessed data and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.

### Deployment with Streamlit
We deployed the trained model using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application for users to input laptop specifications and receive price predictions.

## Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in `laptop_data.csv`. This dataset contains information about various laptops and their corresponding prices.
